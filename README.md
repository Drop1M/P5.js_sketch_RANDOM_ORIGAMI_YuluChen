# RANDOM ORIGAMI – p5.js Sketch

## Project Description
This project is a random interactive system 
that simulates the process of paper folding. 
Using code, a flat digital sheet of paper can 
be folded into different origami-like forms 
and unfolded back into a square surface that 
retains crease marks as a form of memory. 
Each interaction generates a new folding 
outcome, allowing the system to produce 
continuous variation while maintaining a 
consistent folding logic.

## How to Run
Download or clone this repository.
Click to fold/unfold the paper.

## Interaction
Visual elements are generated randomly
Sound is triggered during the interaction

## Tools & Libraries
